# Reading_list

## Hello, and welcome to my code. If you are reading this before I have actually edited my readme file to make it look nice than apoligies in advance cuz it's gonna be a lot of random side notes and at some points you may feel as if you are in an infomercial. Okay here we go.

# Who is this app for?

### This app was created for the busy coder who loves to read. Now you can simply search for a book within the comfort of their own terminal. 

# how do I use it?

### simply type in node Booksearch.js and a search paramater. You can look for a particualr book, a genre or just a supject ex:

## node BookSearch.js Moby Dick

## A table will then display five different books based with the Title, Author and Publisher(as that is the most important part)

# A table within the terminal? but how?

### through the powers of npm console.table which allows you to create much more readable api responses.
